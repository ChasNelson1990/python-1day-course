    "## Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a short command that allows you to access an underlying algorithm. Often a function takes some input data and returns some output data that has been transformed in some way.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already been introduced to, and used, three built-in Python functions: `print()`, `len()` and `type()`. \n",
    "\n",
    "* `len()` takes some input data (usually a string) and returns the length of that string\n",
    "* `type()` takes some input data and returns that data's type\n",
    "* `print()` takes some input data (a string) and prints it to your notebook (we will discuss what `print()` returns below)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has many, many built-in functions and, through packages, other functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "All Python functions have several features in common:\n",
    "* They take zero or more parameters or arguments (inputs)\n",
    "* They always return something (an output or result) \n",
    "* They sometimes *do* something (for instance, print things) \n",
    "* They (should) return useful error messages when something goes wrong\n",
    "* They (should) be well documented\n",
