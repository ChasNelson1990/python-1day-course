    "## Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs can easily become large and unweilding. Functions enable us to break programs down into smaller chunks, making our code easier to understand *and* easier to debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "A further benefit of functions is that they can be reused - it's the 'write once, use often' philosophy of coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already called several built-in functions, which might seem a little bit like black boxes but below we will define our own functions and control their internal workings outselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining functions with `def`\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining our own functions in Python uses a `def` statement and takes the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def my_function():\n",
    "    print('My custom function has been called.')\n",
    "    return\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are five important features of `def` statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Our definition starts with `def`.\n",
    "2. This is followed my a name for our custom function. Function names follow the same rules as variable names.\n",
    "3. After the variable name we need a pair of parentheses (we will come back to these below).\n",
    "4. `def` statements must end in a colon, this signals the start of the code you want to run when your custom function is called.\n",
    "5. The body of a `def` statement must be indented,. Thankfully, Jupyter Notebooks should autoindent lines following a colon for you.\n",
    "6. The final line of a function must `return` something (refer back to Returns in Built-in Functions, Help and Documentation above). If nothing is provided (as here) then the function returns `None`.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Functions and Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the built-in functions we've used so far have input parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are defined by putting the name of a parameter between the parentheses of our `def` statement. In fact, we can include several parameters, like so:\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional Parameters\n",
    "\n",
