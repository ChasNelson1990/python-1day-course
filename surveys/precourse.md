# Pre-course Survey

## Consent

### Introduction

In order to tailor the day's activities to you and other participants we want to ask you a few questions about your role, skills and approach related to this workshop. There will also be a post-course survey and the two surveys together will help us understand the effectiveness of this course. The survey should take less than 10 minutes to complete.

### Confidentiality
Your responses will be recorded anonymously. You will be asked to create a unique and confidential identifier, which will be used to compare results with the post-course survey.

After both surveys have been analyses, individual responses will be deleted and only summary statistics will be kept.

### Consent
