# Python: Hero-to-Zero 1 day course

This repository contains materials for a 1 day python course (delivery dates/methods below)

## Aim

The overall aim of this course it to:

1. introduce the basic concepts of programming in Python within the comfort of the Jupyter framework
2. showcase some of the advanced functionality available in Python by demonstrating (and providing take-home resources) numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn and pandas code

## Philosophy

Our general philosophy for this course is

1. teach in small chunks starting by introducing theory, demonstrating an example, working through a simple case and then setting an exercise. Each exercise is then gone through as a group.
2. teach through errors, error messages and documentation - so that trainees can debug their own codes after they leave the course
3. create a safe environment for asking any and all questions.
